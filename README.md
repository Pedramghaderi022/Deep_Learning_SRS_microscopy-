# Deep_SRS_microscopy-

 Hyperspectral stimulated Raman scattering (SRS) microscopy is a label-free
technique for biomedical and mineralogical imaging which can suffer from low signal-to-noise
ratios. Here we demonstrate the use of an unsupervised deep learning neural network for rapid
and automatic denoising of SRS images: UHRED (Unsupervised Hyperspectral Resolution
Enhancement and Denoising). UHRED is capable of “one-shot” learning; only one
hyperspectral image is needed, with no requirements for training on previously labelled datasets
or images. Furthermore, by applying a k-means clustering algorithm to the processed data, we
demonstrate automatic, unsupervised image segmentation, yielding, without prior knowledge
of the sample, intuitive chemical species maps, as shown here for a lithium ore sample.
